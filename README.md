# jeopardy_score
This is a Python program that uses PySimpleGUI to keep track of the score in a game of Jeopardy. After the inital setup there is a host window for adding and subtracting the score and a client window which has a table with the player names, scores, and scores from the round before. This program also has support for getting the question number from PowerPoint. Instructions on how to do this will be available soon.
## Installation
Simply clone this repository and run main.py. You may need to add PySimpleGUI (You can do this by running `pip install pysimplegui` in cmd or terminal). Note that this program has only been tested on Windows 10, so your mileage may vary on other operating systems. If you find any bugs, please let me know!

Details on how to use this program with PowerPoint will be available soon!
